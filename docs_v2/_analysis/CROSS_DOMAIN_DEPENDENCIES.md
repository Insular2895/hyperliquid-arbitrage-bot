| Producer/concept | Consumers | Contract implication |
|---|---|---|
| ActualFill | Execution, Inventory, Recovery, Accounting, Replay | Actual exchange truth drives exposure |
| Clock | Data, Infrastructure, Replay, Simulator, Monitoring | Monotonic internal; synchronized wall clock + uncertainty cross-machine |
| EdgeSurvival | Participants, Simulator, Sizing, Infrastructure | Use latency distribution, not a scalar |
| Q_validated | Simulator, Risk, Sizing, Portfolio, scaling | Capital cannot exceed validated evidence |
| InventoryBands | Risk, Sizing, Bridge, Terminal Viability | Bands are calibrated and cannot bypass hard limits |
| SimulationConfidence | Simulator, Risk, Sizing | Low confidence reduces/refuses risk |
| OWA comparator | Routing, Formula, Bridge, Accounting | No valid direct comparator means Bridge/relocation, not OWA |
| InfraHealth | Risk, Execution, Operations | Unsafe infrastructure forbids new risk |
